    <div class="w50 caption ptop pleft"> Computer viruses and fungi, though belonging to vastly different realms—technology and nature, respectively—share striking similarities in their behavior and impact. Both entities invade hosts, exploit their resources, and replicate, often causing significant harm in the process. Just as fungi can spread across an ecosystem, computer viruses can proliferate through networks, disrupting systems and compromising data. Understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of these "patients" is crucial for developing effective defenses.

                ILOVEYOU virus worked by sending a bogus “love letter” that looked like a harmless text file. 
                This attacker sent copies of itself to every email address in the infected machine’s contact list. Shortly after its May 4 release, it had spread to more than 10 million PCs. <br> <br>
                The virus was created by a college student in the Philippines named Onel de Guzman. Lacking funds, he wrote the virus to steal passwords so he could log into online services he wanted to use for free. He reportedly had no idea how far his creation would spread.

                    The worst computer virus outbreak in history, Mydoom caused estimated damage of $38 billion in 2004, but its inflation-adjusted cost is actually $52.2 billion. Also known as Novarg, this malware is technically a “worm,” spread by mass emailing. At one point, the Mydoom virus was responsible for 25% of all emails sent.
                    <br> <br>
                    Mydoom scraped addresses from infected machines, then sent copies of itself to those addresses. It also roped those infected machines into a web of computers called a botnet that performed distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks were intended to shut down a target website or server. Mydoom is still around today, generating 1% of all phishing emails.

                History of Illness: <br> 
                The 2017 WannaCry computer virus is ransomware, a virus that takes over your computer (or cloud files) and holds them hostage. The WannaCry ransomware ripped through computers in 150 countries, causing massive productivity losses as businesses, hospitals, and government organizations that didn’t pay were forced to rebuild systems from scratch.
                <br> <br>
                The malware raged like wildfire through 200,000 computers worldwide. It stopped when a 22-year-old security researcher in the U.K. found a way to turn it off. Computers with out-of-date operating systems were hit especially hard. That’s why security experts always recommend updating your systems frequently.

                History of Illness: <br>  
                First observed in 2001, the Code Red computer virus was yet another worm that penetrated 975,000 hosts. It displayed the words “Hacked by Chinese!” across infected web pages, and it ran entirely in each machine’s memory. In most cases it left no trace in hard drives or other storage.
                <br> <br>
                It was the first large-scale, mixed-threat attack to successfully target enterprise networks.The Code Red worm was first discovered and researched by eEye Digital Security employees Marc Maiffret and Ryan Permeh when it exploited a vulnerability discovered by Riley Hassell.
                They named it "Code Red" because they were drinking the Mountain Dew flavor of the same name at the time of discovery.
                <br> <br>
                Financial costs are pegged at $2.4 billion. The virus attacked websites of infected computers and delivered a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the U.S. White House’s website. In fact, the White House had to change its IP address to defend against Code Red.
